			<h2> About the legend</h2>
			<p class="text">
				Ronald James Padavona (July 10, 1942 – May 16, 2010), better known by his stage name Ronnie James Dio, was an American heavy metal singer and songwriter. A truly unique musician that will never be forgotten,  known for his medieval themed lyrics. Dio possessed a powerful versatile vocal range capable of singing both hard rock and lighter ballads; according to Rainbow/Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, upon hearing him sing <i>"I felt shivers down my spine."</i>.
			</p>
			<p class="text">In addition, Dio was a commanding presence, matching his majestic vocals with theatrical hand and arm gestures. 	He was synonymous with heavy metal and very likely introduced the metal salute, the devil horns, to the public.
			 	There have been many singers that have copied his stage moved and were inspired by his vocal technique, but there has never been anyone like Ronnie James Dio, one of the greatest metal legends of all time.</p>
			 <p class="text">The most tragic thing about Ronnie James Dio’s death from metastasized stomach cancer in 2010 is that it likely could have been prevented. Dio, the man who’s commanding voice will live forever in metal history, was 67 when he died and he had not been tested for stomach or colorectal cancer in at least 10 years. The American Cancer Foundation recommends men and women over the age of 50 at average risk for developing colorectal cancer receive a colonoscopy every 10 years to detect and prevent the spread of colon cancer.</p>
			 <h2> Stand Up and Shout </h2>
			 <p class="text">Formed in honor of the legendary singer who lost his life to stomach cancer, The Ronnie James Dio Stand Up and Shout Cancer Fund is a non-profit charitable fund dedicated to support cancer prevention research, raise awareness and educate the public with the focus that early detection and prevention is of vital importance when dealing with this deadly disease that robs families of it's loved ones.</p>

			<h2> By a friend </h2>
			<blockquote>
			    <q class="text">Ronnie loved what he did, making music and performing onstage. He loved his fans so much. He was a kind man and would put himself out to help others. I can honestly say it’s truly been an honor to play at his side for all these years. His music will live on forever. The man with the magic voice is a star amongst stars, a true professional. I’ll miss you so much, my dear friend.
